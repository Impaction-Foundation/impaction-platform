#### <mark style="background-color:green;">Sustainability</mark>

* Additionality: A carbon project is considered additional when its emissions reductions or removals would not have occurred without the funding from carbon credits. If a carbon credit is not additional, it effectively has no impact and does not bring your company or our planet closer to net zero.
* Afforestation: The process of planting trees in areas where there were no forests previously. One of the project activity types that fall under the blanket term ARR (Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation).
* Avoidance or Avoided Emission: The practice of preventing CO2 emissions that would have occurred in the absence of a specific intervention or project, like capturing methane at a landfill.
* Avoided Deforestation: The act of protecting and preventing land from being deforested. When a project prevents illegal deforestation, such as unpermitted logging in a protected area, it is called Avoided Unplanned Deforestation. When it prevents legal deforestation, such as the permitted clearing of a forest for a cattle ranch, it is called Avoided Planned Deforestation.
* Baseline: This represents the greenhouse gas emissions or removals that would have occurred if a carbon project had not been implemented. A project‚Äôs climate impact, and therefore the number of credits it is issued, is determined by quantifying the difference between the baseline and actual project performance. A well-constructed baseline is critical to ensure the credibility of a project‚Äôs climate benefits.
* BECCS: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage - A technology where biomass is used to generate energy, and the CO2 produced is captured and stored underground, effectively preventing carbon from being released into the atmosphere.
* Biochar: Carbon-rich charcoal produced from organic materials through a high-temperature heating process called pyrolysis. When biochar is applied to soil or used in construction materials such as concrete, it locks away carbon that would otherwise have been released into the atmosphere through natural decomposition.
* BVCM: Beyond Value Chain Mitigation - A mechanism through which companies take action or make investments outside of its value chain. BVCM can be used to reduce a company‚Äôs overall climate impact or reach net zero but it need not be. Purchasing carbon credits is an example of a BVCM action.
* Carbon Budget: The maximum amount of CO2 that can be emitted while still limiting global warming to a specific target, such as 1.5¬∞C set by the Paris Agreement.
* Carbon Credits: Financial instruments that represent the reduction or removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These credits are issued to projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and are universally measured in metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions (see tCO2e).
* Carbon Credit Methodology: A detailed, peer-reviewed framework that establishes the rules, procedures and requirements for how a carbon project must quantify its climate impact, demonstrate additionality, and monitor its performance in order to earn carbon credits. Registries and other organizations develop methodologies that set specific standards for different types of carbon projects.
